Combine CSS files and Javascript files into single file in the correct order. Use the latest modified time in filename generation to ensure freshness. Load all external Javascript files asynchronously.


## Description

The cache is updated when the wp_enqueue version number changes or when the `Minit_Plugin:cache_bump()` method is fired.


## Screenshots

1. All CSS files combined in a single file
2. All external Javascript files loading asynchronously
